# AeroGeneticOptimizer

AeroGeneticOptimizer is an innovative aerodynamic optimization tool that leverages an in-house-developed genetic algorithm, specifically Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), to optimize wings.

## Features

- **Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO):** A bio-inspired algorithm for efficient exploration of large solution spaces.
- **RANS CFD Integration:** Detailed aerodynamic performance evaluation through the Navier-Stokes equations.
- **Customizable:** Easily adapt the code for various aerodynamic optimization tasks.
